Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student at the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/), under the co-supervision of Professor Marco Canini (KAUST). During my PhD I have visited Professor Anne-Marie kermarrec lab at [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). My primary research interests revolve around artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on deep learning and Federated Learning.

I have studied Mathematics and Physics at the University of Sfax. In 2020, I received my Diplôme d’Ingénieur in Computer Science and Engineering from the National School of Computer Science (ENSI). In 2022, I received my Master of Science in Computer Science from KAUST.
